\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Computes a hash for the given sequence. The hash represents the index at which the sequence would be located if all possible sequences of the same length were sorted. This function is designed for fixed length squences.

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Computes a hash for the sub-\/sequence starting at the given position in the sequence and of the given length. The hash represents the index at which the sub-\/sequence would be located if all possible sequences of the same length were sorted. This function is designed for fixed length sequences.

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Computes the hash each kmer (at every offset) in the sequence using a Rabin-\/\+Karp rolling hash implementation.
