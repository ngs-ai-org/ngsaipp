Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1BedReader}{ngsai\+::\+Bed\+Reader}} \\*A class to perform sequencial reading from a BED file using the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1BedReader_a8b5cfe6bdb68efacd467698896f850d4}{get\+Next()} method. Currently BED 6 format is handled }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1BedReader}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1CcsKineticExtractor}{ngsai\+::\+Ccs\+Kinetic\+Extractor}} \\*The \doxylink{classngsai_1_1CcsKineticExtractor}{Ccs\+Kinetic\+Extractor} allows to extract inter pulse durations (IPDs) and pulse widths (PWDs) in given region from mapped Pac\+Bio CCSs. The region are always specified in reference coordinates (the reference onto which the CCS is mapped). The window specifies a region, on one of the reference strands, as a semi open interval \mbox{[}from, to). Then, if the CCS maps over this reference region, the CCS sequence, IPDs and PWDs values corresponding to the window are extracted. The sequence, IPDs and PWDs are always returned in 5\textquotesingle{} to 3\textquotesingle{} order with respect to the window strand (that is on the reference) }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1CcsKineticExtractor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1genome_1_1CpGRegion}{ngsai\+::genome\+::\+Cp\+GRegion}} \\*Models the coordinates of a CpG on the genome. CpG are palyndromic sequences. Hence, if a CpG is located on a strand, another is located on the other strand (but in reverse orientation). For this reason, the strand information is always UNORIENTED. A CpG is encoded as a two Genomic\+Region containing \mbox{[}start,end) ranges (0-\/based) for each strand CpG. The starts are always the position of the leftmost C on both strands and the end positions the position just after the rightmost G on both strands. This corresponds to the following schema \+: start end $\vert$ $\vert$ 5\textquotesingle{} -\/ N N N C G N N N -\/ 3\textquotesingle{} fw strand 3\textquotesingle{} -\/ N N N G C N N N -\/ 5\textquotesingle{} rv strand $\vert$ $\vert$ start end }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1genome_1_1CpGRegion}}{}

This model models a window of IPD/\+PWD signal of L consecutive bp. L is named the model size. This model is a special case of the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1PairWiseKineticModel}{Pair\+Wise\+Kinetic\+Model}. The \doxylink{classngsai_1_1PairWiseKineticModel}{Pair\+Wise\+Kinetic\+Model} accounted for all N = ((L$\ast$L) -\/ L) / 2 pair-\/wise position interaction whereas this one only considers L-\/1 interactions between any two directly neighbouring positions in the window. Except for this, everything is the same as in \doxylink{classngsai_1_1PairWiseKineticModel}{Pair\+Wise\+Kinetic\+Model} }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1DiPositionKineticModel}}{}

Instead of modelling the raw kinetic signal like the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1DiPositionKineticModel}{Di\+Position\+Kinetic\+Model} class, this class models kinetic ratios (normalized). Each stretch of kinetic values (IPD or PWD) x1,x2,...,xL is normalized by the expected kinetic signal given the DNA sequence s1,s2,...,sL associated to the kinetic values. This model models a window of IPD/\+PWD signal of L consecutive bp. L is named the model size. This model is a special case of the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1PairWiseNormalizedKineticModel}{Pair\+Wise\+Normalized\+Kinetic\+Model}.

\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1KineticSignal}{ngsai\+::\+Kinetic\+Signal}} \\*\doxylink{classngsai_1_1KineticSignal}{Kinetic\+Signal} class is designed to be a data structure to store the DNA sequence and kinetic -\/ IPD and PWD -\/ information in a given strech of DNA. An instance has a size, that is the length of the DNA strech, in bp, that is modelled. The default contructor allow to create empy -\/ 0bp -\/ streches and to add data later using the setter methods. In this case, the size is set at the 1st use of a setter. Except this 1st insertion -\/ on an empty instance -\/ data inserted must have the same size as the instance }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1KineticSignal}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1KmerData}{ngsai\+::\+Kmer\+Data}} \\*Class allowing to model a kmer together with per sequence position IPD and PWD data. Each of the sequence position corresponds to the same data vector index }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1KmerData}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1KmerMap}{ngsai\+::\+Kmer\+Map}} \\*The \doxylink{classngsai_1_1KmerMap}{Kmer\+Map} is a template class allowing to create a map storing per kmer kinetic information. It is designed to allow O(k) insertion and O(1) query operations using a Rabin-\/\+Karp hashing approach. Each kmer is kinetic information is stored in a pair, together with the number of insertions in the map made for the corresponding kmer. The memory footprint of the map is N$\ast$$\ast$k where N is the number of character in the alphabet -\/ the alphabet is defined in ngsai\+::base\+\_\+code in \doxylink{dna__utility_8hpp}{dna/dna\+\_\+utility.\+hpp}) -\/ and k is the kmer size }{\pageref{classngsai_1_1KmerMap}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classngsai_1_1NormalizedKineticModel}{ngsai\+::\+Normalized\+Kinetic\+Model}} \\*Made to model the IPD and PWD signal from Pac\+Bio CCS. This model models a window of IPD/\+PWD signal of L consecutive bp. L is named the model size. Instead of modelling the raw kinetic signal like the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1RawKineticModel}{Raw\+Kinetic\+Model} class, this class models kinetic ratios (normalized). Each stretch of kinetic values (IPD or PWD) x1,x2,...,xL is normalized by the expected kinetic signal given the DNA sequence s1,s2,...,sL associated to the kinetic values. In the end, as for the \doxylink{classngsai_1_1RawKineticModel}{Raw\+Kinetic\+Model} class, the signal models contains 2$\ast$L different distributions of signal. The distributions at each position are empiric and are made of 2$\ast$L histograms h\+\_\+ipd(1), h\+\_\+pwd(1), h\+\_\+ipd(2), h\+\_\+pwd(2) ..., h\+\_\+ipd(\+L), h\+\_\+pwd(\+L). The model can be trained (feed with data) in order to fill the underlying histograms and estimate the signal distributions at each position in the window. If the model is feed with a vector of IPD values X x1, x2, ..., xL and a vector of PWD values Y y1, y2, ..., yL corresponding to a DNA sequence S s1, s2, ..., sL, each value xi and yi will be normalized into n(xi) n(yi) using a normalizing function accounting for the sequence context S. Then each histogram h\+\_\+ipd(i) and h\+\_\+pwd(i) will be added a count corresponding to the value n(xi) an n(yi) respectively. h\+\_\+ipd(1) will be added a count corresponding to n(x1), h\+\_\+ipd(2) will be added a count corresponding to n(x2), ..., h\+\_\+ipd(\+L) will be added a count corresponding to n(x\+L). The same will apply for the PWD histograms with normalized Y values. Once the histograms have been filled, the model can be normalized in order to transform the 2$\ast$L histograms into 2$\ast$L probability densities. At this moment, the model can compute the likelihood of observing a a strech of signal of length L with IPDs X x1, x2, ..., xL and PWDs Y ~\newline

This model models a window of IPD/\+PWD signal of L consecutive bp. L is named the model size. This model accounts for pair-\/wise relaitions ships between any two positions in the window. There are exactly N = ((L$\ast$L) -\/ L) / 2 pair-\/wise relations. The signal in the Lbp window is modelled using 2$\ast$N different distributions of signal -\/ N for IPD and N for PWD signal. Each distribution is modelled by a 2D histogram representing the signal at one position p in the window with respect to the signal found at the paired position q in the window where p != q. Overall the window signal is modelled by 2$\ast$N histograms h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+p\+\_\+q and h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+p\+\_\+q \+: h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+1\+\_\+2, h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+1\+\_\+3, ..., h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+1\+\_\+L, h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+2\+\_\+3, ..., h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+2\+\_\+L, ..., h\+\_\+ipd\+\_\+\+L-\/1\+\_\+L and h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+1\+\_\+2, h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+1\+\_\+3, ..., h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+1\+\_\+L, h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+2\+\_\+3, ..., h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+2\+\_\+L, ..., h\+\_\+pwd\+\_\+\+L-\/1\+\_\+L. The model can be trained (feed with data) in order to fill the underlying histograms and estimate the signal distributions at each pair of positions in the window.
